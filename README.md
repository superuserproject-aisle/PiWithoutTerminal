# PiWithoutTerminal
Are you new to the Raspberry Pi? This will help you do things easily that would normally require you to use the terminal.
To use these, download the ZIP file on this page by clicking the green "Code" drop down arrow and clicking "Download ZIP". Then, go to Downloads in the file manager and right click the ZIP. Click "Extract Here".
You can now delete the ZIP if you'd like. Go to the "PiWithoutTerminal" folder. You must now select all the files, right click on them, click "Properties", go to the "Permissions" tab, and change the "Execute" drop-down to "Anyone".
Now click "OK". You can double click on the file of your choice and click "Execute in Terminal".
I hope you enjoy these scripts!
